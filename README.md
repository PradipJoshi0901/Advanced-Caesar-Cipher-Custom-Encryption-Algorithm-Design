# Advanced-Caesar-Cipher-Custom-Encryption-Algorithm-Design
Designed and implemented a secure encryption algorithm by enhancing the classical Caesar cipher using random key shifting, bitwise operations, and permutation logic. Tested algorithm with multiple inputs and explored theoretical and practical aspects of modern cryptographic design in cybersecurity.
